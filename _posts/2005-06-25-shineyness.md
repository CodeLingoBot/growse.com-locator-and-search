As promised, here goes. Cool stuff that I got cheap from New York:

It's fab. Everyone should get one. Stuff the Ipod. This holds 5Gb, is cheaper
than the Ipod mini 4Gb, and is actually smaller. And you don't have to use
whatever piece of crap software that Apple have decided to throw up today
which means there's no danger of deleting everything by mistake. You just plug
it in, and it comes up as a removable drive, so you can put pretty much
anything you like on it. The back is also rather shiney:

And just to prove exactly how shiney, I turned the flash off.

![Even more shiney][3]

OOooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.............

So there we go, now everyone can stop complaining :)
